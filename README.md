Hello, S. M. Shahriar here. I'm a forward-thinking person with a creative mind. I am currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at American International University-Bangladesh. My favorite programming languages include C#, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and Python. I've also accomplished various projects in these languages.
